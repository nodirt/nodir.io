Today I've discovered, thanks to a customer, that two weeks ago
[ComponentOne Studio® for Entity Framework](https://componentone.com/SuperProducts/StudioEF),
the main product I worked on,
[won Code Project Members Choice 2012 award](http://www.componentone.com/SuperPages/Awards/)
in the Big Data Solutions category at Microsoft’s TechEd 2012 conference
in Orlando

This award is the best thing I ever achieved and thus I am super excited.
Such awards are a great source of motivation.
